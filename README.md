## Proposal
Why do some countries do really well in the Olympics? What factors influence olypic performance at the country and athlete level? What countries and athleties will preform well at the next olympics? This proposal seeks to answer those questions. Using the vast dataset from the 2016 olympics, we seek to determine the most influencial factors that relate to medal performance of olympic atheletes, and build a predictive model that can forcast olympic performance for the next summer olympics. 

This analysis could provide multiple investment opportunities related to sports/olympic consumer market sizing, athelete endorsements, sports analytics, and sports betting, to name a few possibilities.

## Machine Learning Model 
We plan on creating multiple models in order to find a model with the highest prediction score. Models under consideration are a simple linear regression, logistic regression (with a binary output of "won a medal" vs. "did not win a medal"), and a decision tree/random forest model. Optimally, we can rank predictions of olympic performance by country
