# Dashboard Summary

The dashboard for the group project will utilize JavaScript, Mapbox, Plotly, and HTML. A draft dashboard was created in Tableau for the Section 2 deliverables to show the base dashboard format and functionality.

### The dashboard will be broken down into 4 sections:
1. Filter functions on country and sport
2. Country heatmap with multiple selectable layers, including:
  * Total medals
  * Medals based on GDP per capital
  * Medals based on population or number of athletes competing
3. Chart or graph comparing total medals against the factor determined to be most important for predicting Olympic performance
4. Table or identifiers displaying the results of the machine learning model

### The tools used for each of the sections above include:
1. D3 selectors, forEach loops, JavaScript filters
2. Mapbox API connection
3. Plotly
4. HTML tables
